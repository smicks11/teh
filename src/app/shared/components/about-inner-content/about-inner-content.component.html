        <p>How it all started</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Jesus Children Missions Outreach was founded by Mrs. Rosemary Odigbo in
        2001 in the city of Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. Prior to starting the
        ministry, Mrs. Odigbo worked as a missionary for about a decade in Kwara
        State and other parts of Nigeria. In many rural communities in Nigeria,
        poverty and less than Ideal socio-economic situations put the lives of
        many children at risk. Inadequate educational facilities, lack of proper
        nutrition and medical care centres, in general make many parts of rural
        Nigeria very high risk places to raise children. In view of this, Jesus
        Childre Missions' focus is on less privileged children particularly from
        rural areas. Some of the children from these areas, especially the
        orphans who are generally socially and econonmically vulnerable, often
        lack proper care,physical security from abuse and molestation,
        education, adequate nutrition and proper clothing and medical care among
        other things. Girls raised in these environments are often forced into
        early marriages which greatly diminish their potential in life. It is
        not uncommon to find children from these environments loitering in

        of their unique economic challenges, children from these backgrounds are
        sometimes saddled with adult responsibilities such as providing for
        their families, being care givers to much younger members of their
        families and generally doing all they can to survive. Most of the kids
        in these deplorable economic conditions have lost their parents at an
        early age to HIV/AIDS or other life threatning diseases. In addition to
        surviving on their own, these children are often stigmatized or rejected
        by their communities, thus compunding their already very weak positions
        in society. These observations and experiences as a missionary and
        involvement with Children as well as working with different people
        groups both in the urban and the rural areas and her commitment to
        serving God was the main driving force behind the establishment of the
        Missions Outreach.

        <p>THE CHILDREN HOME/ORPHANGE</p>
      </div>
      <p>This vision is still standing since 2001, with the help of notable stakeholders, individuals, organizations staffs, volunteers at different period. It is on this note, we recognize the impact made by these Angels of Hope and heroes who have stood for humanity and projecting this dreams passionately through JCMO.</p>
      <p>The home started with 11 children between the ages of 4-10, among who were children of missionaries, they were all from socially high risk rural communities in Nigeria. 
        With very little or no support, sight unseen, path unknown. Our goal was and still is to give them a positive chance to maximize their potentials in life, by providing sustainable access to food, shelter, health, education and Godly living. All to the best interest of a child that deserves healthy growth and soundness in life.
        </p>
        <p>Creation of out of school programmes, allowed the children to safely explore independence, peer relationships and leadership qualities and to form a long-lasting relationship with the wider world. Our children showed exceptional leadership skills in their schools, being made prefects. The school administration attested to this at available opportunities via school representation in debates, dance, poetry and even in essay competitions etc.</p>
        <p>JCMO is a big family via her children’s full participation in decision makings with a keen sense of responsibility. we have weekly room appraisal to monitor the progress chart of the children which is assessed by each room governor.
        </p>
        <p>The Home followed a Child Protection Policy to ensure that all Caregivers and visitors affirm their commitment to protecting the rights of every child in the home as always and our guests can testify to this. The appreciation note is given to show gratitude for coming and to acknowledge every visit and donations made.
          Our children are encouraged to make friends, visit friends and the friends’ in turn comes by to the Home to visit them. Every child is attached to a Caregiver, who monitors the child, attends to the child and provide big brother or big sister needs.</p>
        <p>The care givers are exposed to training programmes and are made to adhere to the code of conducts set through the Child right Protection Policies and the Organization. No year runs out without training programs for our Caregivers. Notable among these is the two days training, organized by Civil Defense (South West Headquarters;) on SEXUAL AND GENDER BASE VIOLENCE, headed by Officer Afe.</p>
        <p>Targets at first intake are children between a days old -14 years from various settings and with different story backgrounds. </p>
