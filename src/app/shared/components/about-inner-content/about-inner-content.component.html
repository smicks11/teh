        <p>How it all started</p>

      <p>
        Jesus Children Missions Outreach was founded by Mrs. Rosemary Odigbo in
        2001 in the city of Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. Prior to starting the
        ministry, Mrs. Odigbo worked as a missionary for about a decade in Kwara
        State and other parts of Nigeria. In many rural communities in Nigeria,
        poverty and less than Ideal socio-economic situations put the lives of
        many children at risk. Inadequate educational facilities, lack of proper
        nutrition and medical care centres, in general make many parts of rural
        Nigeria very high risk places to raise children. In view of this, Jesus
        Childre Missions' focus is on less privileged children particularly from
        rural areas. Some of the children from these areas, especially the
        orphans who are generally socially and econonmically vulnerable, often
        lack proper care,physical security from abuse and molestation,
        education, adequate nutrition and proper clothing and medical care among
        other things. Girls raised in these environments are often forced into
        early marriages which greatly diminish their potential in life. It is
        not uncommon to find children from these environments loitering in
        economically depressed sections of Nigerian cities and villages. Because
        of their unique economic challenges, children from these backgrounds are
        sometimes saddled with adult responsibilities such as providing for
        their families, being care givers to much younger members of their
        families and generally doing all they can to survive. Most of the kids
        in these deplorable economic conditions have lost their parents at an
        early age to HIV/AIDS or other life threatning diseases. In addition to
        surviving on their own, these children are often stigmatized or rejected
        by their communities, thus compunding their already very weak positions
        in society. These observations and experiences as a missionary and
        involvement with Children as well as working with different people
        groups both in the urban and the rural areas and her commitment to
        serving God was the main driving force behind the establishment of the
        Missions Outreach.
