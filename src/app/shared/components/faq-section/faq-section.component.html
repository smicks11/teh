                Our children are drawn from different parts of the country including rural settings where there are no schools, or because of abject poverty, vulnerability, orphaned, indigent or missionaries others are through the collaborations of the Ministry of Women Affairs, Civil Defense Corps, the Police, Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA), RRT and concerned citizens.

                It is a mission home with different operational units. These are, Children home, field work in villages, Care for widows and senior citizens (the elderly). We also operate schools for the children under our care and management ( Tender lift Care mission Schools both in Ibadan and Gberupane village in Kwara State). And community Projects.
Jesus Children Missions Outreach is purely Faith based organization (FBO) that depends on charity and donations to operate. The Ministry, partners with the Oyo State Ministry of Women Affairs and is a registered organization with the Corporate Affairs Commission, Nigeria.

                We typically accept children from 1 day old to 15years. Children outside of these age bracket will be considered on a case by case basis. Because we have been operational since 2001, most of the children we started with are now grown up. The age range of the children and young adults under our care and management currently ranges from 2months old to over twenty years. All young adults older than 18 years who have yet to gain admissions to higher institutions of learning and/or vocational schools are trained and given opportunity to be responsible as care givers and administrative volunteer workers and receive stipends until they gain admission into universities or other higher institutions with full sponsorship by the Ministry.
