          <p>Tenderlift Care Missions Schools which comprises of Nursery, Primary and Junior High Schools, in both urban and rural settings, suffered a setback just like other schools were affected by the lockdown. Though our major challenges still remain Staff/Teachers and the registration of the schools with the appropriate agencies in the State. Our motto is Sound Teaching and Wisdom. The challenges of funds for adequate running is still a limitation.</p>
          <p>The population of the schools, in 2020 was 159, of which 70% were from the shelters. (righteousness, Peace and Joy Homes) 20% are orphaned and vulnerable in the community on scholarship while others are fee payers whose funds boost the financial obligations of the schools a little. Our major source of funding remain donations/charity.</p>

          <p>JCMO, as an entity believes strongly on the need to get back to the Society that has given us this hope, space and love. What we do under this is clear, we recognize ‘a child’ ‘the community’ and play a part as affordable.
          </p>
          <p>Community children placed on scholarship, receives different form of supports including assisting their parents/relations care for them, ranging from Medicals, Accommodations, and other forms of support, made available. One of such who has been on the list over 7 years, is, Mrs. Oladeji, one of the widows in our project, who lives in a dilapidated apartment. We made visible project success, through funds raised for her. We bought 6 bundles of roofing sheets, cements and planks for renovation. Her medical bills and medications was handled. She was supported during the pandemic. Mattress, pillow, foodstuff and cash was made available at all time for her. </p>
